# SFM_PARROT_THESIS

Aerial Topographic Survey Using a Monocular Camera.

The objective of the project is to generate a 3D Map, identifying features of trees in an aerial view using a low cost drone (ARDRONE-PARROT V1).
All this implemented as a package in ROS.

# PIPELINE
1. Implement the navigating system for ARDRONE-PARROT-V1 using ROS.
2. Design of SFM algorithm using Opencv3 and python.
3. Implement an intelligent classifier and image processing algorithm which counts and estimates the height of trees.
4. Encapsulate all as a package in ROS.
